# Foam Ball Shooter

This was the project I worked on during the summer of 2025. I wanted to design something with my 3D printer on my own. I decided to create something to shoot ping pong balls or similar, and I expanded this idea into an automatic foam ball launcher.

## Mechanical Design
Before designing anything, I wanted to decide on two main parts of the mechanism: how the balls would be fed into the flywheels, and whether to use one or two motors for the flywheels. I decided to use flywheels (instead of something pneumatic) because it is much simpler, especially when making parts with a 3D printer. Ultimately, I decided to use one motor for both flywheels. This is because I already had one high-power motor, and even if using two identical motors, there would be a slight difference in speed, which is difficult to tune due to being much higher power than the ESP32. Having only one motor also makes the assembly much lighter. For the feeding mechanism, I decided to use a gravity-based system, do to its simplicity. The balls would be dropped into the flywheels in a controlled manner (using a servo), rather than a more complicated option like a solenoid or belt to move them into the flywheels.<br/><br/>

By choosing only to use one motor, I had to figure out how to move the rotation from the motor itself to the 2 driveshafts the flywheels would be attached to. I quickly decided to place the motor in the middle of the assembly, since it is the majority of the weight of the part, and I wanted to ensure it was well balanced, since I was planning to have the barrel tilt and rotate. I narrowed my options to a belt and a gear array. I decided on using belts, since I could buy 3D printer belts, belt gears and idlers. However, standardized gears would not work, and so I would have had to print gears myself. I decided against this because the plastic gears would likely have been much too weak or would have had to be very large to support the high forces of the motor. <br/><br/>

After deciding on how the core part of the shooter would work, I started designing the main feeder/barrel part of the launcher. I designed the parts to be light and strong, while trying to keep the required supports when printing to a minimum. In the end, I decided to make the shooter in one main part, with the motor and belts mounted to a separate, smaller part, as well as a separate magazine part to reduce the print size. This way, the main body would be one strong part, and I could also remove or modify the magazine to reduce its size. <br/><br/>

In the design of the shooter, I wanted to try to minimize any use of hardware (screws, bolts/nuts, etc.) and make the fastening between parts integrated within the design. I used poles protruding from the main body, which inserted into the motor mount assembly to keep it in place. I also added a spot for a zip tie to go around the motor for a more permanent and secure attachment. In most other places, I used friction fits to secure things like bearings and the flywheels.

### Belt Drive Design

The most complex part of the shooter to design was the belt drive. The main initial issue with a belt system was that by directly driving both driveshafts, one would spin the wrong way. I solved this by driving a shaft next to one of the driveshafts, and 2 gears to reverse the spinning direction. However, this caused a problem where the smaller shaft (the one with the belt gear and direction reversing gear) would be pulled towards the middle of the belt, creating a lot of friction between the 2 printed gears. I solved this by adding a stabilizing part above it, connecting the shaft to the driveshaft and reducing how much it tilted. When designing the spacing for the belt gears and motors, I tried to design it in such a way that a standard belt loop size would fit; however, I realized I could 'splice' a straight belt, saving the ~$20 it costs for a set of closed-loop belts. This meant I could make it any size I wanted. I initially tried to use this to my advantage by not using a tensioner; however, I quickly realized that the belt was too loose, but too tight with one less tooth in the loop - meaning I needed a tensioner. I designed 2 options, using a screw and a nut to adjust the tightness. I remade the belt and found the ideal tension.<br/><br/>

However, after testing this belt design with a real flywheel, the motor started skipping on the belt. I realized that I either needed to remake the entire belt assembly or fit a tensioner next to the motor, such that the motor would have more belt surface to contact. I settled on modifying the tensioner to be on the outside of the belt, next to the motor shaft. This kept tension and increased the surface area enough to prevent motor skipping.

### Flywheel Design

The design of the flywheels was the most tedious, requiring lots of trial and error. I initially used a solid plastic wheel with elastics on the outside to add friction. I thought this would work with the foam balls, since they would deform to create the required force to shoot the ball. However, when testing, I found that this compression had very little stored energy, so the ball would not have much speed exiting the barrel. I tried bigger flywheels to compress the ball more, but the ball did not pass through the flywheels. So, I decided to look into more deformable options. This also had the advantage of being able to shoot harder balls, like ping pong balls or even golf balls if soft enough. I looked into plastic and rubber wheels for suitcases or moving tables, but ultimately settled on buying a roll of TPU filament. This is because TPU is very flexible, and I would be able to print any shape I wanted for the flywheel. I used the TPU as an outside, and the standard plastic (PETG) to secure it to the shaft. I used a few different sizes of flywheel and different amounts of infill to change the stiffness and elasticity of the flywheel. I eventually settled on what I have now, and although it could be better, I feel it is good enough, since it shoots the foam balls with an appreciable speed.<br/><br/>

# My Projects

This is an archive of all of the personal projects I've completed over the last few years. I'll include any CAD files and code I've used for the projects, as well as some images, videos and documentation of the projects. Below is a summary of each project I've worked on.

# [Foam Ball Shooter](https://github.com/BenZbor/My-Projects/tree/Foam-Ball-Shooter)

This was the project I worked on during the summer of 2025. I wanted to design something with my 3D printer on my own, using an ESP32. I decided to create something to shoot ping pong balls or similar, and I expanded this idea into an automatic foam ball launcher.
</br></br>

The launcher is made of PETG and works by using a motor to drive a pair of 3D printed TPU flywheels, and the foam balls are gravity-fed into these flywheels, launching the ball. The rate of fire is controlled with a mini servo motor, which prevents/allows the balls to fall into the flywheels.
